#class X(Y) "Make a class named X that is-a Y."
#class X(object): def __init__(self,J) "class X has init that uses self and J parameters"
#class X(object): def M(self,J) "class X has-a function named M that uses self and J parameters"
#foo = X() "Set foo to an instance of class X"
#foo.M(J) "From foo get function M and call it with parameter self, J"
#foo.K = Q "From foo get the K attribute and set it to Q"

#sessions and tracking users

#web applications: maybe we want to keep track, web is stateless -> every request you take is treated as independent
#most common way to track: creating a little place for data storage with identification number unique for every browser
#number matched against a little piece of data stored on browser called cookie
#called session tracking

#creating an engine

#web game engine to display scenes, collect input, keep track of where player is in game
#web engine will start new game for new players, show current scene, take input, process user input and moving him forward, display results

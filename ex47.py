#automated tests

#testing guidelines

#test files go in tests/ and are named project tests, otherwise nosetests won't work
#one test file for each module
#test cases and functions short, usually kind of messy
#keep clean and remove repetitive code
#do not get too attached with your tests, otherwise delete it and start over
